//!# Thundr Render Pipelines
//!
//!Thundr supports drawing surfaces in multiple ways which have different
//!performance characteristics.
//!
//!* `CompPipeline` - a compute pipeline that performs composition and
//!  blending in compute shaders.
//!* `GeomPipeline` - renders surfaces using a traditional graphics
//!  pipeline. Surfaces are drawn as textured quads.
//!
//!The compute pipeline sees the majority of development, and the
//!geometry pipeline is a fallback. The geometry pipeline may perform
//!better in certain situations, such as with software renderers.
//!
//!The `Pipeline` trait outlines how the main Thundr instance interacts
//!with the pipeline code. All pipeline resources must be isolated from
//!Thundr, but Thundr resources may be modified by the pipeline implementation.
//!
