//! # Vulkan Compositor
//!
//! Also known as the `vkcomp` subsystem.
//!
//! The naming of this subsystem is somewhat confusing. It is called a
//! compositor, but it seems to act as a window manager and doesn't
//! actually do any composition itself. Category5 is the compositor,
//! but `vkcomp` is the code that handles window composition. `vkcomp`
//! takes the current state of the `atmosphere` and draws the windows on
//! the user's display.
//!
//! `vkcomp` itself is just the behavior for generating draw commands and
//! handling window presentation. The window positions are determined by
//! `ways` and `input`, and the Vulkan rendering is handled by `thundr`.
//!
//! `thundr` exists because during development I observed that the type of
//! Vulkan renderer I was creating could be reused in other places. For
//! example, a UI toolkit might also want to composite multiple buffers or
//! panels together to make a user interface. `vkcomp` is just one such
//! usage of `thundr`.
//!
//! ### Code
//! * `wm` - The window manager
//!   * `wm` specifies how to draw a typical desktop. There are a
//!   collection of applications at various sizes/positions, a desktop
//!   background, toolbars, etc. It generates a list of surfaces which are
//!   handed to `thundr` to be drawn.
//! * `wm/tasks.rs` - A list of tasks that the atmosphere passes to
//! vkcomp. These are one-time events, and usually just tell `vkcomp` that
//! an object was created and it needs to allocate gpu resources.
//! * `release_info.rs` - Release info are structs that specify values to
//! drop after `vkcomp` is done using them. This is used to release
//! wl_buffers once they are no longer in use by the gpu.

// We need to create the tree of modules that make up
// the vulkan compositor:

// Window Manager: This provides a nice API for the
// upper layers to create/move/modify windows. It
// takes care of driving the Renderer
// Does not contain any vulkan or unsafe code.
